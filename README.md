###  My name is Sérgio Henrique👋
I'm currently studying C and JavaScript.
Systems Analysis and Development Academic - IFPB.
I'm interested in learning Java and TypeScript in the future.

In the world of programming, my goal is to constantly improve my skills to become a prominent professional,
and always improve my knowledge by learning new technologies that will help me solve problems.

I'm a dedicated lifelong learner. I quickly learn new skills and programming languages and in recent years 
I have dedicated a good part of my studies to learning the most varied technologies of the Javascript ecosystem, including Express, NestJS, TypeScript and React.
